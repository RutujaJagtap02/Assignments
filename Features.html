    <h2><u>Features of Java 1.8 </u></h2>
    <p>
      Java 1.8 (also called Java 8) introduced major new features like Lambda
      Expressions, Stream API, new Date/Time API, Optional class, and default
      methods in interfaces. <br />
      These changes made Java more powerful, concise, and closer to functional
      programming.
    </p>
    <h3>Features</h3>
    <p>
      1]Lambda Expressions : Write short code blocks that act like small
      functions, making code cleaner. <br />
      2]Functional Interfaces : Interfaces with just one abstract method, used
      with lambdas for simplicity. <br />
      3]Method References : Call existing methods directly without writing extra
      code. <br />
      4]Stream API : Process collections (like lists) easily with filtering,
      mapping, and reducing. <br />
      5] Default Methods in Interfaces : Add new methods to interfaces without
      breaking old code. <br />
      6] Static Methods in Interfaces : Interfaces can now have utility methods
      inside them. <br />
      7] Optional Class : Helps avoid null errors by wrapping values safely.
      <br />
      8]New Date and Time API : Easier and more reliable way to handle dates and
      times. <br />
      9]Collectors Class : Collect results from streams into lists, sets, or
      maps. <br />
      10] ForEach() Method : Loop through collections in a simpler way. <br />
      11] Nashorn JavaScript Engine : Run JavaScript code inside Java. <br />
      12] Parallel Array Sorting : Sort arrays faster using multiple CPU cores.
      <br />
      13] Base64 Encode/Decode : Built-in supp- ort for encoding and decoding
      Base64 data. <br />
      14] Type and Repeating Annotations : More flexible ways to use
      annotations. <br />
      15]Concurrency Enhancements : Better tools for handling multi-threaded
      programs. <br />
      16]JDBC Enhancements : Improved database connectivity features.
