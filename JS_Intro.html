    <h1><b><u>Introduction to Java Script </u></b></h1>
    <h2>1] Data types in JS</h2>
    <p>
        JavaScript has different types of data:
        <ol>
        <li>String: text</li>  
        <li>Number: Any numbers</li> 
        <li>Boolean: true</li> 
        <li> Array: list of items</li> 
        <li>Object: key-value pairs</li>  
        </ol>
        <pre>
            1) In String datatype it has text value 
                Ex: "Hello"
            2) In Number datatype we can store any number (whole number or decimal number)
                Ex: 59 , 3.14
            3) In Boolean datatype it has True or False value
                Ex: True, False
            4) In Array we have list of items 
                Ex: let A = [1, 2, 3]
            5) In object it has key value pair 
                Ex: let Student =   {
                                    name: "Rutuja",
                                     age: 20,
                                    };
        </pre>
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h2>2]Function</h2>
    <p>
        Function is a block of code that does a specific task. we can reuse the function whenever 
        we want . it saves our time from rewriting same code again and again.
    </p>
    <pre>
        Here a simple ex of Function

        -we can create function using function keyword
        <b>Ex:</b>
        Function myname() {
            console.log("Rutuja");
        }
        -we can call this function
        myname();
        then output will be "Rutuja"
    </pre>
    <hr>
    <h2>3]Variable</h2>
    <p>
        variable is like a container that stores data. <br>
        JavaScript gives us three keywords to declare variables

    </p>
    <h3>1]let</h3>
    <p>
        We Use let to declare a variable.
        We can change its value later.
        <pre>
            it only works inside {} where it’s declared.</pre>
        <pre>
            <b>Ex:</b>
                let name = "Rutuja";
                name = "Jagtap"; // This is allowed
        </pre>
        
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h3>2]Var</h3>
    <p>
        It is also a way to declare variables.
        it Works like let, but it has different rules about where it's visible.
        <pre>
            it works inside the whole function.
        </pre>
        <pre>
            <b>Ex:</b>
                var age = 25;
                age = 30;
        </pre>
        
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h3>3]Const</h3>
    <p>
        It is Used to declare a variable that cannot be changed.
        Once you give it a value, then we cannot change it.
        <pre>
             <b>Ex:</b>
                const country = "India";
                country = "USA"; 
        </pre>
        <b><u>Points to Remember</u></b> <br>
        Use <b>let</b> when the value will change. <br>
        Use <b>const</b> when the value should stay fixed. <br>
        Avoid var in modern code (it can cause confusing bugs).
       
    </p>
    <h2>4]Static Typed Language and Dynamic Typed Language</h2>
    <pre>
    Static Typed Language:
            We must need to declare types like int, string, float, etc.
            The computer checks for type errors before running the program.
            If We try to assign a different type later, it gives an error.
                <b>Ex:</b>(Java):
                    int age = 25; 
                    age = "twenty Five"; 
    </pre>
    <p>
       Languages like C, Java, TypeScript
    </p>
<hr>
    <pre>
    Dynamic Typed Language:
            In Dyanic Typed language We don’t declare types — just assign values.
            The computer figures out the type while running.
            We can also change the type later without errors.
                <b>Ex:</b> (Python):
                    age = 25      
                    age = "twenty" 
</pre> 
<p>
    Languages like JavaScript, Python
</p>
<hr>
<h2>5]Hoisting</h2>
<p><u>What is hoisting:</u></p>
<p>Hoisting in JavaScript means that all variable and function declarations 
    are moved to the top of their scope before the code runs.</p>
<p>During the creation phase, declarations (not initializations)
    are moved to the top of their scope. This is called hoisting</p>
        <b>Ex:</b>
    <pre>
        Variables declared with var are hoisted and initialized with undefined
            console.log(x); // undefined
            var x = 5;
        let and const: These are hoisted too, but they remain in the Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) until initialized. 
        Accessing them before declaration throws an error
            console.log(y); // ReferenceError
            let  y = 10;
    </pre>
    <p>
        Declarations are hoisted, initializations are not.  <br>
        var are hoisted with undefined. <br>
        let and const are hoisted but inaccessible until initialized (TDZ). <br>
        Function declarations are fully hoisted.
    </p>
