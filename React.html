    <h1><u>React</u></h1>
    <p>
      React is a JavaScript library that helps developers build fast,
      interactive, and reusable user interfaces for websites and apps. <br />
      It’s mainly used to make web pages dynamic, meaning they update instantly
      without reloading.
    </p>
    <u><b>What is React?</b></u>
    <p>
      React is a tool created by Facebook to build user interfaces. <br />
      It focuses on components — small building blocks of code that can be
      reused. <br />
      It’s especially popular for single-page applications (SPAs), where content
      updates without refreshing the whole page.
    </p>
    <u><b> where can we use React?</b></u>
    <p>
      Websites: To make pages interactive (like Facebook, Instagram). <br />
      Web apps: Dashboards, e-commerce sites, or booking systems. <br />
      Mobile apps: With React Native, you can build iOS and Android apps using
      the same concepts.
    </p>
    <u><b> Why do we use React?</b></u>
    <p>
      It makes development faster because you can reuse components. <br />
      It improves user experience with smooth updates and no page reloads.
      <br />
      It’s backed by a huge community, so there are lots of resources and
      support.
    </p>
    <u><b>Advantages of React :</b></u>
    <p>
      Reusable components: Write once, use everywhere. <br />
      <br />
      Fast rendering: Uses a “Virtual DOM” to update only what’s needed. <br />
      <br />
      SEO-friendly: Helps websites show up better in search engines. <br />
      <br />
      Flexibility: Works with other tools and frameworks easily. <br />
      <br />
      Cross-platform: Build mobile apps with React Native. <br />
      <br />
      Strong community: Tons of tutorials, libraries, and support available.
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      In short: React is like Lego blocks for web development — we build small
      pieces (components) and combine them to create big, interactive
      applications quickly and efficiently.
