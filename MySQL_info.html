    <h1><u>MySQL</u></h1>
    <p>
      MySQL is a popular open-source relational database management system
      (RDBMS) used to store, organize, and query structured data. <br />
      We can use it by installing MySQL, creating databases and tables, and
      running SQL commands to insert, update, and retrieve data. <br />
      MySQL is popular because it is free, fast, secure, and easy to use. It
      stores data in tables and lets you query it with SQL.
