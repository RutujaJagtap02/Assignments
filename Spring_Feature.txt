Spring Boot is a tool in Java that makes building applications easier and
faster by removing complicated setup.
Spring is like a toolbox for Java developers. Instead of writing everything from scratch, 
Spring gives you pre-built solutions for common problems such as connecting to databases, 
handling security, or managing big applications. 
It makes code clean, organized, and easy to test.

Features :
1)Fast Development: Quickly build apps without writing too much setup code.

2)Auto-Configuration: It guesses and sets things up for you automatically.

3)Embedded Server: You don’t need to install a separate server; it comes built-in.

4)Microservices Friendly: Perfect for breaking big apps into smaller, manageable parts.

5)Easy Integrations: Works smoothly with databases, security, and cloud tools.

6)Production Ready: Apps can run live without extra effort.

7)Wide Adoption: Used by many companies, so it’s reliable and well-supported.

    It reduces boilerplate code (no need to write repetitive setup).
    It makes applications scalable and maintainable.
    It’s open-source and widely used, meaning lots of community support.
