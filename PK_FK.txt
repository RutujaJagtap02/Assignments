1]Primary Key :
 Unique Identifier: Each row in a table must have a unique value in the primary key column.
 No Duplicates: Two rows cannot share the same primary key value.
 No Empty Values: Primary keys cannot be NULL.
 Each table can have only one primary key (but it can be made of multiple columns together).
 Example: In a Students table, the student_id column could be the primary key.
 Every student has a unique ID number.

 2]Foreign Key :
 A foreign key is like a reference to another table’s primary key.
 Creates Relationships: A foreign key connects one table to another by referencing the other
 table’s primary key.
 Ensures Valid Data: It makes sure that the value in the foreign key column exists in the linked table.
 Example: In an Enrollments table, the student_id column could be a foreign key that points to the 
 student_id in the Students table. This ensures that every enrollment record belongs to a real student.
