    <h2>1. Props (short for "Properties")</h2>
    <p>
      Props are like inputs you give to a component. <br />
      How they work: Props are read-only → you can’t change them inside the
      component. <br />
      They make components reusable because you can pass different values each
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Example: <br />
      function Greeting(props) { <br />
      return Hello, {props.name}!; <br />
      }
    </p>
    Props = external data (like arguments to a function).

    <h2>2. Hooks</h2>
    <p>
      Hooks are special functions in React that let you “hook into” features
      like state, lifecycle, and more. <br />
      <br>
      <u>Why they exist:</u> <br />
      Before hooks, React used classes for state and lifecycle. Hooks made
      everything simpler and usable in functional components. <br />
      <br>
      <u> Common Hooks:</u> <br>
      useState → lets you add state to a component. <br />
      useEffect → lets you run code when something changes (like fetching data
      or updating the page title). <br />
      useContext → lets you share data across components without passing props
      manually. <br />
      useRef → lets you directly access DOM elements or keep values between
      renders.
    </p>
    Hooks = special functions that give components superpowers (like state, side effects, etc.).
