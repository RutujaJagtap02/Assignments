    <h1><u>Join</u></h1>
    <p>
      In MySQL, a JOIN is used to combine rows from two or more tables based on
      a related column. <br />
      It helps you pull connected information together (like linking customers
      with their orders). There are several types of joins, each controlling how
      data is matched and displayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <u> What is a JOIN ?</u> <br />
      A JOIN links tables together using a common column (often a foreign key).
      <br />
      Example: We have a Customers table and an Orders table. To see which
      customer placed which order, you join them using CustomerID. Without
      joins, you’d have incomplete data because each table only stores part of
      the information.
    </p>
    <h2><u>Types of Joins in MySQL</u></h2>
    <p>
      1. INNER JOIN : <br />
      Returns rows where there is a match in both tables. <br />
      If a customer has placed an order, you’ll see them. If not, they won’t
      appear. its like "Show me only the overlaps." <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      2. LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN) : <br />
      Returns all rows from the left table, and matched rows from the right
      table. <br />
      If there’s no match, you still see the left table’s data, but the right
      side will show NULL. <br />
      its like "Show me everything from the left, even if no match exists."
    </p>
    <p>
      3. RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN) : <br />
      Opposite of LEFT JOIN. <br />
      Returns all rows from the right table, and matched rows from the left
      table. <br />
      If no match, left side shows NULL. <br />
      Think of it as: "Show me everything from the right, even if no match
      exists." <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      4. FULL JOIN (or FULL OUTER JOIN) :<br />
      MySQL doesn’t support FULL JOIN directly, but you can simulate it using
      UNION. <br />
      Returns all rows when there is a match in either left or right table.
      <br />
      Think of it as: "Show me everything from both sides, matched or not."
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      5. CROSS JOIN :<br />
      Returns the Cartesian product (all possible combinations of rows). <br />
      If Customers has 10 rows and Orders has 5 rows, result = 50 rows. <br />
      Think of it as: "Mix everything with everything." <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      6. SELF JOIN: <br />
      A table joined with itself. <br />
      Useful for hierarchical data (like employees and their managers). <br />
      Think of it as: "Compare rows within the same table."
