    <h2>1]Anonymous Function</h2>
    <p>An anonymous function means a function without a name.</p>

    <h1><u>Introduction to DOM </u></h1>
    <p>
      The DOM (Document Object Model) in JavaScript is like a map of our webpage
      that JavaScript uses to find and change things on the page.
    </p>
    <p><u>What is DOM</u></p>
    <p>
      DOM stands for Document Object Model. <br />
      It’s a tree-like structure that represents all the elements on a webpage
      (like headings, paragraphs, buttons, etc.). <br />
      When a webpage loads, the browser creates this structure so JavaScript can
      interact with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <u>What can JavaScript do with the DOM?</u> <br>
      Change text or images on the page Add or remove elements (like showing a <br>
      popup or hiding a menu) Change styles (like making text bold or changing <br>
      colors) Respond to user actions (like clicking a button or typing in a form) <br>
    </p>
    <p>
        Imagine our webpage is a TV. The DOM is the remote control that JavaScript uses
         to change the channel, adjust the volume, or turn the TV on/off.
    </p>

    <h2><u> Events in JavaScript</u></h2>

         Mouse Events: click, dblclick, mouseover, mouseout
         Keyboard Events: keydown, keyup, keypress
         Form Events: submit, change, focus, blur
