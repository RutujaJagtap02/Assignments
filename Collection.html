    <h1><u>Collection</u></h1>
    <p>
      A Collection in Java is a framework that provides classes and interfaces
      to store and manipulate groups of objects. <br />
      The collections has three main branches: List, Set, Queue. <br />
      It makes handling data easier (adding, removing, searching, sorting).
      <br />
      It includes interfaces (like List, Set, Queue, Map) and their
      implementations (like ArrayList, HashSet, etc.). <br />
    </p>
    <p>collections is like a big container that holds groups of objects.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2><u>1]List</u></h2>
    list Means Ordered collection (things stay in the order we put them). <br />
    It has Ordered collection means elements are stored in sequence. <br />
    it Allows duplicates.The same element can appear multiple times. <br />
    It has Index-based access . we can get elements by their position. <br />
    it Maintains insertion order so elements stay in the order you added them.
    <br />
    <p>Common Implementations:</p>
    <p>1)ArrayList</p>
    <p>
      Based on dynamic arrays. <br />
      It is Fast for searching (random access). <br />
      Slower for inserting/removing in the middle. <br />
      ArrayList → like a resizable array.
    </p>
    <p>2)LinkedList</p>
    Based on doubly linked list. <br />
    Fast for inserting/removing anywhere. <br />
    Slower for searching. <br />
    LinkedList → good for adding/removing items quickly.
    <p>3)Vector</p>
    Similar to ArrayList but synchronized (thread-safe). <br />
    Used less nowadays. <br />
    Vector → older version of ArrayList, synchronized.
    <hr />
    <h2>2]Set</h2>
    Set has Unique collection (no duplicates allowed). <br />
    Order depends on the type of Set. <br />
    No duplicates allowed . each element must be unique. <br />
    Order depends on implementation. <br />
    Useful when uniqueness matters (like storing IDs).

    <p>Common Implementations:</p>
    <p>1)HashSet</p>
    In Hashset we Stores elements in a hash table. <br />
    Very fast for add, remove, search. <br />
    No guaranteed order. <br />
    HashSet → fast, but no order.
    <p>2)LinkedHashSet</p>
    Stores elements in hash table + linked list. <br />
    Maintains insertion order. <br />
    <p>3)TreeSet</p>
    Stores elements in a tree structure. <br />
    Keeps elements sorted (ascending order). <br />
    Slower than HashSet but useful for sorted data.
    <hr />
    <h2>3]Queue</h2>
    Works like a line of people waiting. <br />
    It Follows FIFO (First In, First Out). <br />
    Used when processing tasks in order. <br />
    Some queues allow priority-based ordering. <br />

    <p>Common Implementations:</p>
    <p>1)PriorityQueue</p>
    Orders elements by priority (not just insertion order). <br />
    Example: tasks with higher priority executed first. <br />

    <p>2)ArrayDeque</p>
    Double-ended queue. <br />
    Can add/remove from both ends. <br />
    Faster than LinkedList for queue operations. <br />
    LinkedList (also works as a Queue) <br />
    Can act as both List and Queue. <br>
    Examples: PriorityQueue → elements ordered by priority. <br>
    ArrayDeque → double-ended queue (can add/remove from both
    ends). <br />
    <hr />

    <h2>Map</h2>
    Map (separate from Collection interface but part of framework) <br />
    Stores data as key-value pairs. <br />
    Keys must be unique, values can repeat. <br />

    <p>Common Implementations:</p>
    <p>1)HashMap</p>
    Stores data in hash table. <br />
    Very fast for search and insert. <br />
    No order maintained.

    <p>2)LinkedHashMap</p>
    Maintains insertion order of keys.

    <p>3)TreeMap</p>
    Stores keys in sorted order. <br />
    Slower than HashMap but useful for ordered maps.

    <p>4)Hashtable</p>
    Older version of HashMap. <br />
    Synchronized (thread-safe). <br />
    Rarely used now. <br />
    <p>
      Examples: HashMap → fast, no order. <br />
      LinkedHashMap → keeps insertion order.<br />
      insertion order. TreeMap → keeps keys sorted. <br />
      Hashtable → older, synchronized.
