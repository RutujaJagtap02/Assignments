    <h2><u>1.The Common Root:Throwable</u></h2>
    <p>
      In Java, both Error and Exception are subclasses of the Throwable class.
      <br />
      Only objects of type Throwable (or its subclasses) can be thrown using
      throw and caught using catch.
    </p>

    <h2><u>Error</u></h2>
    <p>
      What is an Error? : <br />
      Definition: Errors indicate serious problems that occur at runtime,
      usually outside the control of the program. <br />
      Errors = Fatal problems, outside program’s control. <br />
      Examples: <br />
      - OutOfMemoryError → JVM runs out of memory. <br />
      - StackOverflowError → Too many recursive calls overflow the stack. <br />
      - NoClassDefFoundError → Required class not found. <br />
      - Key Point: Errors are not meant to be caught or handled by applications.
      They usually signal that the program should terminate. <br />
      - Think of an Error like a system crash—we can’t fix it from inside our
      program.

    <h2><u>Exception</u></h2>
    <p>
      What is an Exception? <br />
      Definition: Exceptions represent conditions that a program can anticipate
      and recover from. <br />
      In Java, exceptions can be caught and handled using try-catch blocks so the program doesn’t 
      crash. <br>
      Exceptions = Handleable problems, inside program’s control. <br />
      Examples: <br />
      - IOException → Input/output operation fails. <br />
      - NullPointerException → Accessing a variable that points to null. <br />
      - ArithmeticException → Division by zero. <br />
      - Key Point: Exceptions should be caught and handled using try-catch
      blocks or declared with throws.
    </p>
    <p>Types of Exceptions</p>
    <p>
      1]Checked Exceptions: <br />
      - Checked at compile-time. <br />
      - Must be either handled (try-catch) or declared (throws). <br />
      - Example: IOException, SQLException. <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      2]Unchecked Exceptions (Runtime Exceptions): <br />
      - Checked at runtime. <br />
      - Not required to be handled explicitly. <br />
      - Example: NullPointerException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. <br />
